Github is AWESOME! I learned so much this week for example pushing adding and commiting
I am excited to continue to learn how to use Github as many people use it to build a team
code base, or even demonstrate how their code works!

Date 2.5.26 - Subject Team App

This week we started to chose what our app was going to be like! We have descided that we are going to create
a "Roomate hub" that has a bunch of cool features! We are going to be able to join our apts and have a ability
to see chores, talk to our roomates, have a feed of pictures from our roomates, special logins, a dark mode!
its going to be pretty awesome! I'll update you when we have more progress.

Date: 2.10.26 - Subject: Git Merges

Now that we’re working as a team, things are getting real! We’re starting to use Merges, which is how we combine all 
our individual work into one master project. Basically, we each work on our own "branch" (like our own little sandbox)
so we don't mess up each other's code. When we’re done, we merge it all back together. Sometimes we might have Merge
Conflict, which is just a fancy way of saying two people edited the same thing! But it’s honestly a rite of passage to
fix one.

Date: 2.19.26 - Subject: Team Presentation

This week we worked on putting together our presentation for Roommate Hub! It was actually really cool seeing everything come together in a more “official” way. We had to clearly explain our idea, the features we’re building, and how the app will actually work. It made me realize how much progress we’ve already made as a team. We divided up the slides so everyone could talk about the parts they worked on, which made it feel more organized and professional. I’m a little nervous to present, but I’m also excited because I think our idea is solid and people are going to like it.

Today we finally presented Roommate Hub! Honestly, it went way better than I expected. All the preparation we put into the slides and practicing really paid off. Everyone on the team did a great job explaining their parts, and it felt really smooth overall. I was definitely a little nervous at first, but once we started talking about the app and all the features, it felt natural because we’ve been working on it for weeks now. It was awesome showing off what we built and seeing people actually interested in it. Now it feels real.
