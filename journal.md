Github is AWESOME! I learned so much this week for example pushing adding and commiting
I am excited to continue to learn how to use Github as many people use it to build a team
code base, or even demonstrate how their code works!

This week we started to chose what our app was going to be like! We have descided that we are going to create
a "Roomate hub" that has a bunch of cool features! We are going to be able to join our apts and have a ability
to see chores, talk to our roomates, have a feed of pictures from our roomates, special logins, a dark mode!
its going to be pretty awesome! I'll update you when we have more progress.
